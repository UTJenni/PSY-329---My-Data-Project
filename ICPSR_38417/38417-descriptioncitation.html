		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The National Couples' Health and Time Study (NCHAT) is a population-based study of couples in America that contains representative samples of racial and ethnic diverse and sexual and gender diverse individuals. NCHAT entered the field on September 1, 2020, and data collection completed in April 2021. The sample includes 3,642 main respondents. The sample frame included adults in the United States who ranged in age from 20-60 years old, who were married or cohabiting, and who were able to read English or Spanish. About 1,515 partners participated. NCHAT sample participants were recruited through the Gallup Panel. About 9 percent of the sample was non-Latinx Black, 6 percent non-Latinx Asian, 5 percent non-Latinx Multirace, 16 percent Latinx, and 1 percent another racial or ethnic identity. Approximately 55 percent of the sample identified as heterosexual, 20 percent as gay or lesbian, 10 percent as bisexual, and 15 percent as another sexual identity or multiple sexual identities. The sample was about evenly split between men and women, and almost 3 percent identified as another gender identity. 27 percent of couples were the same gender, and 4 percent were non-binary. About 75 percent were married and the remainder were cohabiting. The average age was 45. 65 percent of the sample had no children. One-third of the sample was in an interracial couple. 10 percent were born outside the US. Survey, time diary, experience sampling method, and geospatial data were collected. NCHAT is uniquely suited to address COVID, stress, family functioning, and physical and mental health and includes an abundance of contextual and acute measures of race and racism, sexism, and heterosexism.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences of co-habiting partners, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, examining relationship functioning, emotion regulation, discrimination, racial trauma, physical health, psychological well-being, health behaviors, stressors, and time use.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The National Couples' Health and Time Study (NCHAT) sample participants were drawn from the Gallup Panel and the Gallup Recontact sample. Both sample sources are probability-based and are representative of the United States adult population. The survey was administered to respondents and their partners. At the end of the survey for the primary respondents, the respondents were informed they would be sent an email with instructions for inviting their partners. Within a few hours of completing the survey, the partner invitation was sent to the primary respondent.</p>
<p>Once the main survey was completed, respondents were invited to participate in the time-diary. Respondents were randomly assigned to a time-diary day. The diary covered a 24-hour time period, starting at 4 am on the assigned diary day. The time-diary day was approximately 10 to 14 days after the date the main survey was completed. This allowed time to give respondents advance notice of their day and to increase the chances of being able to assign the primary and partner respondents to the same time-diary day. A time-diary was counted as complete if they entered at least five activities and 180 minutes. (Not all of these cases were weighted. Please see the weighting section for more details about cases that received a weight).</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The sample includes 3,642 main respondents. The sample frame included adults in the United States who ranged in age from 20-60 years old, who were married or cohabiting, and who were able to read English or Spanish. About 1,515 partners participated. The National Couples' Health and Time Study (NCHAT) sample participants were recruited through the Gallup Panel. About 9 percent of the sample was non-Latinx Black, 6 percent non-Latinx Asian, 5 percent non-Latinx Multirace, 16 percent Latinx, and 1 percent another racial or ethnic identity. Approximately 55 percent of the sample identified as heterosexual, 20 percent as gay or lesbian, 10 percent as bisexual, and 15 percent as another sexual identity or multiple sexual identities. The sample was about evenly split between men and women, and almost 3 percent identified as another gender identity. Twenty-seven percent of couples were the same gender, and 4 percent were non-binary. About 75 percent were married and the remainder were cohabiting. The average age was 45. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no children. One-third of the sample was in an interracial couple. Ten percent were born outside the United States.</span></p>

								<div><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2024-06-26 The Public-Use Main Respondent data file (DS1) was updated by the Principal Investigators to include 1 new AAPI variable. The computed AAPI variable includes respondents who endorsed Asian American Pacific Islander race/ethnicity categories in variables RACE_4_SUPP through RACE_14_SUPP. A syntax file has been made available in a zipped package for DS1 to document the AAPI variable creation. The ICPSR README and zipped package for DS2 were also re-released to update the README documentation.<p>2023-12-11 Question text was added to the ICPSR Codebook and the Social Science Variables Database (SSVD) for all datasets.<p>2023-09-25 Both Main Respondent data files (DS1 and DS2) were updated by the Principal Investigators to include 11 new "IDENTITY" variables. These are recodes of the original "IDENTITY" variables.<p>2023-03-16 The Dataset 6: Partner Time Diary dataset has been added. Additionally, Dataset 3 and Dataset 4 have been re-released, but only the dataset names have been updated.<p>2023-02-27 The Dataset 5: NCHAT Partner dataset has been added. Additionally, Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 have been re-released, but only the dataset names have been updated.<p>2022-12-12 The Time Diary data set has been added with an accompanying questionnaire. Additionally, the NCHAT Survey data and documentation are being re-released to incorporate fileset name changes, but no changes were made to the data files.<p><p>2022-07-14 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></p></div>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> <p><b>WEIGHT_MAINRESPONDENT</b> is the constructed weight variable to be used for analysis of the main respondent file. This weight should be used when analyzing data from primary respondents and will generate nationally representative estimates of individuals aged 20 to 60 who are living or cohabiting with a partner. This weight can also be used to generate representative estimates when analyzing sub-groups, such as individuals who are in a same-gender or different-gender couple, or individuals who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual.</p>
<p><b>WEIGHT_COUPLE</b> is the constructed weight variable to be used for analysis of couple level data from primary respondents and their partners. This weight should be used when analyzing the dyadic data (primary and partner responses). Cases from the primary respondents and partner respondents should not be treated as individual cases and combined to create a larger sample of individual adults. Weights are not valid for this purpose. Further, this type of analysis would require accounting for clustering within couples and potentially highly correlated responses (intraclass correlation). It is recommended that researchers do not take this approach.</p></span></p>
