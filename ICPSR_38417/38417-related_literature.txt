The National Couples' Health and Time Study (NCHAT) is the first fully-
powered, population-representative study of couples in America containing
large samples of sexual, gender, and racial and ethnic diverse individuals.
Drawn from the Gallup Panel and the Gallup Recontact Sample, when weighted,
the data are population representative of individuals in the United States
who 1) are married or cohabiting, 2) are between 20 and 60, 3) speak
English or Spanish, and 4) have internet access. The data were collected
between September 2020 and April 2021 in the midst of a global pandemic as
well as racial and political upheaval. NCHAT includes surveys of 3,642 main
respondents and 1,515 partners along with time diaries. We describe the
sampling process, challenges weighting a diverse population-representative
samples, and sociodemographic characteristics of the NCHAT. These data will
provide opportunities for new research on the health and well-being of
American families.
